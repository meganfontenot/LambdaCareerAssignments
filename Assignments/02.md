## Review the materials in Training Kit on Sharing your Story and Networking Fundamentals: https://learn.lambdaschool.com/cr/sprint/recevxobvossg3nzd

## 1. Write a paragraph (6-8 sentences minimum; it should take about 1 minute to read aloud) about your journey to/in Lambda School. Make it unique to you, and include the three components of sharing your story:

> - Your “why”
> - What you’re learning and how you use it
> - What you’re most excited about next

(Paragraph too long need to revise)

After graduating from a very small school in Louisiana, to say that I had any knowledge of computer science is an extreme understatement. It wasn't until later, living in New Orleans working (quite unhappily) as a paralegal that I came across a video of the Top 10 Happiest Careers. Six minutes in, and Software Engineering made its debut. My ears kind of shut off. I’m no math and science genius, so the prospect of a career like this couldn't possibly be for me. But I couldn't get it out of my head. I wasn't ready to enroll in school, but my interest was peaked. I signed up for a few online classes from websites like Udemy, and Code Tree House and I could not get enough. One weekend I’m working through a free code camp tutorial and I open a new tab to research and a medium article pops up in the results. It’s there that I see an article written about Lambda School and how it has changed lives. I dived into a rabbit hole of articles by or about Lambda School. Fast forward through the “It has to be a scam” stage that we all go through and I’m working through the free pre-course with an AMAZING instructor named Dan. Since then I have enrolled in the main course, learned all about Javascript, React, Node, Express, Preprocessors, and the list goes on. I’ve worked through project weeks and participated in LABS (a program where you and a small team of other students have to take a wire-frame and turn it into a fully functioning application in a few weeks time.) and have since moved into the computer science portion of the curriculum. But by far, I am most proud of the newest challenge in my Lambda journey, in becoming a Section Lead and helping a new cohort of students develop their own LABS projects. I don't doubt for one second that joining Lambda has been the best decision I could have made regarding my personal happiness and future. With the tools and knowledge, I have gained and am currently gaining at Lambda there is no limit to what is achievable.

### ~ Practice saying your paragraph aloud; try to get to the point where you don’t need it as a prompt, and you can say it as if you’re thinking of the words on the spot. It shouldn’t sound scripted.

## 2. Use the Job Search Tool (or an equivalent platform of your preference) to brainstorm and organize your network in the “People in My Network” tab.

> - Job Search Tool: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NCAaKLBLu8YQayvffvR4tmxnggcx84O9yVjH06Yf1yo/edit?usp=sharing
> - Include everyone whose interests or skills could be relevant for you in your job search- this can include people you’ve never met before but with whom you share a common connection.
> - If you’ve already done this with your existing network, then take it to the next level by going on LinkedIn to identify new people whom you may be interested in connecting with.

## 3. Building off the previous challenge, sort your network by relationship strength (in the Job Search Tool), and set goals/a timeline for staying in touch with different groups. The closer the relationship or the more relevant it is to your goals, the more proactive you should be in your maintenance and follow-up.

> - Send at least 5 check-in or follow-up emails this week and next to let your network know what you’re currently doing in Lambda School and what your professional goals are. If these are people whom you’re interested in growing your relationship with, or if they’re potential mentors, then try to schedule coffee, lunch, or another in-person touchpoint for the coming weeks.
