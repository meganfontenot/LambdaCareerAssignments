## Review the materials in Training Kit on Sharing your Story and Networking Fundamentals: https://learn.lambdaschool.com/cr/sprint/recevxobvossg3nzd

## 1. Write a paragraph (6-8 sentences minimum; it should take about 1 minute to read aloud) about your journey to/in Lambda School. Make it unique to you, and include the three components of sharing your story:

> - Your “why”
> - What you’re learning and how you use it
> - What you’re most excited about next

Start of my paragraph here:

### ~ Practice saying your paragraph aloud; try to get to the point where you don’t need it as a prompt, and you can say it as if you’re thinking of the words on the spot. It shouldn’t sound scripted.

## 2. Use the Job Search Tool (or an equivalent platform of your preference) to brainstorm and organize your network in the “People in My Network” tab.

> - Job Search Tool: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NCAaKLBLu8YQayvffvR4tmxnggcx84O9yVjH06Yf1yo/edit?usp=sharing
> - Include everyone whose interests or skills could be relevant for you in your job search- this can include people you’ve never met before but with whom you share a common connection.
> - If you’ve already done this with your existing network, then take it to the next level by going on LinkedIn to identify new people whom you may be interested in connecting with.

## 3. Building off the previous challenge, sort your network by relationship strength (in the Job Search Tool), and set goals/a timeline for staying in touch with different groups. The closer the relationship or the more relevant it is to your goals, the more proactive you should be in your maintenance and follow-up.

> - Send at least 5 check-in or follow-up emails this week and next to let your network know what you’re currently doing in Lambda School and what your professional goals are. If these are people whom you’re interested in growing your relationship with, or if they’re potential mentors, then try to schedule coffee, lunch, or another in-person touchpoint for the coming weeks.
